I used A Credit Card Dataset for Machine Learning. Can be accessed here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction?select=application_record.csv.

The data was described and visualized, decision trees and logistic regression were built with the division of data into train and test sets (sklearn).

Python.
